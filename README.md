# NodeJS Custom Boilerplate Generator

CLI Node application to build the structure of a project in simple steps and quickly. \
This project is inspired by some like [TSDX](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx), [CT3-App](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app), etc.

## Why?

I was needing a quick way to initialize a node project with my own settings and typescript support out of the box.

## Requirements

- [] Create Git repository.
- [] Add Typescript integration.
- [] Add Formatter and linter integration.
- [] Add Tests integration.
- [] Add CI features
- [] Extra files? _(CHANGELOG, LICENSE, README)._
